# First-Project
First Project for Code Louisville


Welcome to my very first Website 
I wanted to try making a simplistic website for my friend who is in real estate and does handyman fixes on the side, this will be a continued project for me
and I am excited for what the future holds. I would like to say it was super easy to do this but I quickly found out that starting with mobile
first is a must and having to go back and make it mobile friendly after having a hundred lines of code is not fun. I hope you enjoy the website
I had a lot of fun making it, well most of it was fun. Enjoy!

To open the project please download the zip file to your pc and go into folder first project master
double click Jon Website folder
double click styles which will have a text editor box open up then close it
double click the scripts then close it 
Proceed to double click the contactMe index Lawnservices and RealEstate as well to open in browser.
Once opened the hyperlinks will work to navigate to each web page.

I tried using the github website to just use the URL but I must have done something wrong and I could not figure it out. 
Sorry for making it so difficult I know you have a lot of Prjects to look at.
